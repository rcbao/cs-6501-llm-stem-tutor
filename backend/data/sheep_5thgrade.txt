In 1997, a 7-month-old sheep named Dolly became a celebrity. Dr. Ian Wilmut, a Scottish scientist, announced to the world that he had created her using a procedure called cloning. Cloning is a method that scientists use to produce a genetic copy of another individual. In other words, Dolly was a clone of her mother. Well, actually, Dolly had three mothers. One mother gave Dolly her DNA, one mother supplied an egg, and the third mother, her surrogate mother, gave birth to her. Normally, an animal gets half of its DNA from its mother and half from its father. Dolly was an identical twin of the mother who gave her her DNA. But Dolly was si years younger. However, Dolly and her mother were not identical in every way. Since Dolly and her XDNA motherY had different eperiences, they were different in many ways. ,ike human twins, clones have uniue personalities. It took scientists 277 tries to succeed in cloning Dolly. To make her, Dr. Wilmut used a complicated method called Xnuclear transfer.Y In this method, scientists remove a nucleus from one cell and transfer, or move, it to a different cell.
