Earth Science - Earthquakes Earth Science - Earthquakes by ReadWorks One summer I was in Las Vegas with my family. Our hotel room was on one of the top floors of a high-rise building. There was a morning of that vacation I will never forget. We woke up around 6 A.M. The building was shaking and swaying back and forth like a pendulum. It was an earthquake. Las Vegas is in the western state of Nevada, which is right next to California. The epicenter was actually in California, but we still felt it over 100 miles away. Earthquakes occur when plates in the earth's crust rub together. This friction causes the surface to shift back and forth. It also makes huge cracks in the ground, sometimes miles long and several feet deep. Luckily, that summer in Las Vegas, my family got out of the building safely. I was never so scared in all my life. Others in history have not been so fortunate. On Jan. 17, 1995, an earthquake struck in Kobe, Japan. It caused over 6,000 deaths. In 1906, a huge earthquake hit San Francisco, killing over 3,000 people and destroying over 25,000 buildings.
