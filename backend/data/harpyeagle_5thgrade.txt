What's This? Iron Grip What's This? Iron Grip This text is provided courtesy of OLogy, the American Museum of Natural History’s website for kids. The harpy eagleis one of the world’s largest birds of prey. With claws as long as a grizzly bear’s, this eagle hunts sloths, monkeys and other mammals. It uses its powerful talons to pluck prey from rainforest branches, puncturing the animal’s organs as it flies to the top of a tree. Then, pinning the prey with its feet, it tears away bits of flesh with its beak to eat or feed its young. Its grip is strong enough to catch and carry an animal close to its own body-weight — up to 20 pounds (nine kilograms)!
