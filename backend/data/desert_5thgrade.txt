The Atacama Desert The Atacama Desert This text is provided courtesy of Vanderbilt University: Center for Latin American Studies. The Atacama Desert is a famous desert in South America. The desert covers 41,000 square miles down the west coast of the country Chile. The Atacama Desert is known for being one of the driest places on Earth! It is so dry that some of its tallest mountains don’t even have glaciers, like other tall mountains do. The desert is made up of stones, salt lakes, sand, and lava. The soil in parts of the Atacama Desert has even been compared to the land on the planet Mars. Many movies and TV shows set in outer space have been filmed there. Some scientists are even experimenting with growing crops in the Atacama… to see if it would be possible to grow them on Mars! These scientists have a tough job. Why? Because of the extreme conditions in the Atacama Desert! The desert has some extreme temperature changes. During the day, it can be over 104… but it can fall down to 40 at night! There is also almost never any rain in the Atacama, so it is very dry. These extreme conditions mean that very few plant and animal species are able to live there. Darwin’s Leaf-Eared Mouse and the South American Gray Fox are among the few animals that can survive in this desert climate. The few plants that grow there have adapted to the extreme conditions. For example, some of the cacti that manage to grow in the Atacama get water not from rainfall or groundwater… but from the fog that comes in off the Pacific Ocean! There have been some exceptions to this extremely dry weather. In July 2011, an arctic front came through the Atacama and brought snow to the desert! Since then, heavy rainfall in 2012 and 2015 brought some flooding to the area. After these brief periods of wetter weather, the desert bloomed with plants! But for the most part, the Atacama remains one of the driest places on Earth.
