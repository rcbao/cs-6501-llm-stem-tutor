Earth Science - The Weather Earth Science - The Weather by ReadWorks Weather is made up of several different components. In order to understand weather, you must understand air temperature, clouds, wind, and precipitation (rain and snow). Weather is never exactly the same everywhere. It is always changing, and depending on what climate you live in, weather can change drastically from mile to mile. The United States uses the Fahrenheit scale to measure air temperature. When the temperature rises on the Fahrenheit scale, it shows that the temperature is hotter. When the temperature goes down, it means that it is getting cooler. Low-pressure systems are associated with clouds and precipitation, while high-pressure systems are normally associated with dry weather and mostly clear skies. Clouds are made up of millions of tiny ice crystals. Clouds high up in the sky are very cold, and look very fluffy. Lower clouds in warmer air look sharper. From clouds, we get rain and snow. Humidity is the measure of water vapor in the air. On a beautiful day, there is low humidity. On a foggy day there is high humidity. On a rainy day there is 100% humidity.
